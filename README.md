## Formal-Verification-of-DDS-Synthesizer-using-Synopsys-Tools

<ul>
<li>Worked on formal verification and bug resolution for a Digital Down Converter (DDS) synthesizer design.</li>
<li>Utilized industry-standard tools including Synopsys Design Compiler, Conformal, and Formality to perform equivalence checking and logic verification.</li>
<li>Identified and resolved mismatches between RTL (Register Transfer Level) and synthesized netlists through detailed debugging and constraint refinement.</li>
<li>Performed synthesis-aware formal verification to ensure functional equivalence across pre-synthesis and post-synthesis designs.</li>
<li>Analyzed timing constraints, applied synthesis optimizations, and validated performance against design specifications.</li>
<li>Improved robustness of the digital signal processing module by resolving logical inconsistencies and improving testability.</li>
<li>Documented verification flow, constraint setup, and debug logs for future reference and team collaboration.</li>
  
</ul>
